    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes algorithm is on one of the supervised learning techniques used for classification types of problems. The core of this algorithm is the probabilistic model which calculates the probabilities of input features and outputs the probalities distributions to each possible class.This algorithm is used for Natural Language processing(NLP) types of application.\n",

    "### Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The main concept of the Bayes theorem is based on what probabilites we know and what we can infer from it. In this model, there are two probablities, prior and posterior. Prior is the probility of a given event to occur, say what is the probability of **Virat Kohli** or **Rohit Sharma** to be the Captain. Posterior is the probility of a given event to occur given a conditon, say what is the probability of Inida to win **given** Virat Kohli is the Captain. That's it, that's the Bayes Theorem. \n",
